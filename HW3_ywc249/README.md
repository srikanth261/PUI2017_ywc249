# README for HW 3

## Objectives
1. Learn about CLT and show it with different distribution in python
2. Learn hypothesis testing procedure
3. Learn to do a Z-test and interpret the result

## Work collaboration
### HW 3-1
Worked with Chun-chieh Tsai together on discussing the best ways to create data structure and plot all the sublpots. Coding are done respectively.
### HW 3-2
Discussed with Chun-chieh Tsai about coding issues (e.g., environmental variable, fetching data) and forming a hypothesis test, but hypotheses and codes are developed respectively.
### HW 3-3
Worked individually.

## Lesson learned
- It's not easy to form a logic and testable hypothesis
- It's even more difficult to wrangle with the data
- For average duration, there is the outliers to dealt with
